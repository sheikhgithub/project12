<p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and
  habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education
  frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners may also educate themselves. Education can
  take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels,
  or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

  Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary
  school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

  A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is
  compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based
  education.
